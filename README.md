# STAT-512-Project
Multiple Linear Regression study using US and global renewable energy datasets.  

## Background Introduction
The United States has made great strides to prioritize renewable energy since the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) was enacted in 1978 [1]. As a result, the use of renewable energy in the United States has grown exponentially [2]. Recent technology booms have further emphasized the need for renewable energy as it fosters energy independence and economic growth in addition to contributing towards a more sustainable future.  

## Datasets and Variables
The datasets used are: 
- [U.S. Renewable Energy Consumption](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alistairking/renewable-energy-consumption-in-the-u-s)

### US Renewable Energy Consumption (1973 – 2024) 
- Year: The calendar year in which the data was recorded. 
- Month: The month of the year (1-12) in which the data was recorded.  
- Sector: The sector of consumption (commercial, electric power, industrial, residential, transportation). 
- Hydroelectric Power: The amount of energy consumed from hydroelectric power, measured in trillion BTUs. 
- Geothermal Energy: The amount of energy consumed from geothermal sources, measured in BTUs. 
- Solar Energy: The amount of energy consumed from solar power, measured in trillion BTUs. 
- Wind Energy: The amount of energy consumed from wind power, measured in trillion BTUs. 
- Wood Energy: The amount of energy consumed from wood burning, measured in trillion BTUs. 
- Waste Energy: The amount of energy consumed from waste burning, measured in trillion BTUs. 
- "Fuel Ethanol, Excluding Denaturant": The amount of energy consumed from fuel ethanol, measured in trillion BTUs. 
- Biomass Losses and Co-products: Biomass losses and co-products in the given sector and month, in trillion BTUs. 
- Biomass Energy Consumption: The amount of energy consumed from biomass sources, measured in trillion BTUs. 
- Total Renewable Energy: The total amount of energy consumed from all renewable sources combined, measured in trillion BTUs. 
- Renewable Diesel Fuel: The amount of energy consumed from renewable diesel fuel sources, measured in trillion BTUs. 
- Other Biofuels: The amount of energy consumed from other biofuel sources, measured in trillion BTUs. 
- Conventional Hydroelectric Power: The amount of energy consumed from conventional hydroelectric sources, measured in trillion BTUs. 
- Biodiesel: The amount of energy consumed from biodiesel sources, measured in trillion BTUs. 

## Research Question
1. Looking at the impact of different renewable sources on the total renewable energy consumption in the U.S. from 1980 to 2021, can the growth in total renewable energy consumption be explained by the combined influence of solar, wind, biomass, and hydroelectric energy?
